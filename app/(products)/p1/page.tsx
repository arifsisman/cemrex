            A radiosonde is a small weather station coupled with a radio transmitter. The radiosonde
            is attached to a helium or hydrogen-filled balloon, generally called a weather balloon,
            and the balloon lifts the radiosonde to altitudes exceeding 115,000 feet. During the
            radiosondeâ€™s ascent, it transmits data on temperature, pressure, and humidity to a sea-,
            air-, or land-based receiving station. Often, the position of the radiosonde is tracked
            through GPS, radar, or other means, to provide data on the strength and direction of
            winds aloft. Thus the radiosonde flight produces a vertical profile of weather
            parameters in the area above which it was launched.
